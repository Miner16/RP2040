## 11/9/2025 12 AM - Started work: THE SCHEMATIC   

The schematic was fairly straight-forward (with some caveats), but I managed to finish it. Ofc it was with the help of the tutorial. I had an AI check it, and there were no apparent mistakes.

## 11/9/2025 1:01 AM - Next step: ROUTING THE PCB (aka hell)  

Today I took on the challenge known as routing the PCB, which I decided to do without the help of the tutorial. Thinking for myself should allow me to become much better at PCB design!

## 11/9/2025 1:11 AM - Finally: FINAL TOUCHES AND ORDER  

Finally the time is here to make the JLC order! But before that id like to add on a little something to make this project really personal for me. I added a famous quote: “I am still learning.” — Michelangelo, along with the Raspberry logo. About the order: after long consideration, I picked to go for PCBA for this project. There is just NO way a newbie like me can solder those tiny pins on the MCU.
