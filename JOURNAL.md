## 11/9/2025 12 AM - Started work: THE SCHEMATIC   

The schematic was fairly straight-forward (with some caveats), but I managed to finish it. Ofc it was with the help of the tutorial. I had an AI check it, and there were no apparent mistakes.

## 11/9/2025 1 AM - Next step: ROUTING THE PCB (aka hell)  

Today I took on the challenge known as routing the PCB, which I decided to do without the help of the tutorial. Thinking for myself should allow me to become much better at PCB design!
